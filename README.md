# rsa_signature_attack_demo

DISCLAIMER: this program was created for educational purposes only, and is by no means instructional and should not be used in real-world applications

This is a proof-of-concept program I made whilst consolidating my understanding of the RSA cryptosystem.
This includes a script of the basic implementation of "text-book" RSA, as well as a simulated forgery
attack that exploits the multiplicative homomorphic property of this basic cryptoscheme.

A full break-down of how this attack works can be found on my blog website (SOON TO BE RELEASED)
